# TSUtils

TSUtils is a library of open-source utilities for TypeScript. It includes utilites such as an interactive console, and a CSS sorting function.

# CLI

CLI is a class that implements an interactive command-line interface, using Node.JS stdout and stdin, and allowing users to enter commands and receive responses in a terminal.

# SortCSS

SortCSS is a function that orders CSS properties with two sorting options: grouping properties by categories (layout, typography...) or alphabetically by property name.
